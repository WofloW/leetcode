Iterative DFS
At first glimpse, I was using visited set() to store the visited node.
But it takes O(N) memory.

Then I looked up other solutions and found out the graph itself is the best way to memorize the visited.
We can paint the node to 1 in the graph to mark it visited.

Whenever we see a 0 in the graph, DFS the adjacent 0. 
As long as DFS don't touch the border and DFS ends, it means there is a closed islands.

Since each node is only visited once, time complexity O(N).
Space complexity O(1)

```python
DIR = [
    (0, 1),
    (0, -1),
    (1, 0),
    (-1, 0)
]

class Solution:
    def closedIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0

        res = 0
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    continue

                stack = [(i, j)]
                is_closed = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    grid[x][y] = 1
                    for dx, dy in DIR:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

                        if not (0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n):
                            is_closed = False
                        elif grid[nx][ny] == 0:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if is_closed:
                    res += 1
        return res
```
