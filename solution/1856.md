# Core:
Recommend trying https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram first.
Then use monotonic stack with prefix sum.

The core is we know the sum of subarray easily by using prefix sum.
**But the minimal number of subarray is hard to know.**

monostack is hard for me to understand. So I hope I can help other.

Increasing monostack: A stack with non-decreasing order.
Why can monostack help us? 
**Monostack can easily help us find that the number v is the minimal number between index i and j with O(N) time like a magic.**

Whenever we iterate the nums one by one and find a number A smaller than the stack top number B. Pop all the number larger than A in the stack.

To be clear, the index here is the index of number in the nums.
number A index i
pop number B index i - 1
the previous number C in the monostack with index x
C < B
A < B
C is the most recent number smaller than B.
Any number after C must be larger than or equal to B.
**B is the smallest number in this closed interval [x + 1, i -1]**

subarray min-product: sum(nums[x+1: i]) * B
**If we can try every number as the min number with the interval as wide as possible(since nums[i] > 1), we will guarantee the result.**


Take 1 3 6 5 2 for example.
The moment we iterate to value 2(index 4).

The current monostack (In the code only index . Value here is easy for readers to understand the concept.)
index [0, 1, 3]
value [1, 3, 5]

pop 5
new monostack
index [0, 1]
value [1, 3]
pop value 5 means 5 is the smallest number between (monostack[-1] + 1) and ((index 4) - 1) which are 2 and 3														
new monostack
index [0]
value [1]
pop value 3 means 3 in the smallest number between (monostack[-1] + 1) and ((index 4) - 1) which are 1 and 3

# A trick here:
Add 0 to the end of nums array. We won't miss the edge case of increasing array. At the same time 0 < any number in nums
Add -1 to the monostack to avoid the first num compare with the empty mono_stack. 
monostack[-1] == -1      nums[-1] == 0
There is no way to find a number in nums less than the last number of nums.

# Full walkthrough:
Take 1 3 5 2 1 for example.
Add 0 to the end. New array is 1 3 5 2 1 0.

To make the monostack easy to understand, I use the value in the stack for explanation. 
But in the code the index is saved in the stack so that we can calculate the sum of subarray with left index and right index.
```
Stack		Compare 	Action		subarray min-product
0			
0 1        	1 > 0		append 1
0 1 3		3 > 1		append 3
0 1 3 5		5 > 3		append 5
0 1 3 		2 < 5 		pop 5		5 * 5
0 1		2 < 3 		pop 3		3 * (3 + 5)
0 1 2				append 2
0 1		1 < 2		pop 2		2 * (3 + 5 + 2)
0 1 1				append 1
0 1		0 < 1		pop 1		1 * (3 + 5 + 2 + 1)
0		0 < 1		pop 1		1 * (3 + 5 + 2 + 1)
0 0				append 0

Result 25
```
