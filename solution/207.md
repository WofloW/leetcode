Build a directed graph that prerequisite courses points to all the courses related to.
Record the indegree of all courses.

Store all the courses with indegree 0 in the BFS queue.
Indegree 0 means we can take this course with no untaken prerequisite. taken_course_count += 1

BFS popleft indicates taking this course.
Whenever we take a course, decrease one indegree from all the related courses. 
We can get the related courses quickly by using the graph.
When decreasing the indegree, the indegree becomes 0. 
Push this course to the queue.

If BFS stops, no more courses can be taken.

taken_course_count == numCourses means we have taken all the courses.
If not there is at least one loop in the prerequisites table.


```python
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        degrees = [0] * numCourses
        
        for p in prerequisites:
            graph[p[1]].append(p[0])
            degrees[p[0]] += 1
            
        q = deque(n for n in range(numCourses) if degrees[n] == 0)

        count = 0 
        while q:
            course = q.popleft()
            count += 1
            for neighbor in graph[course]:
                degrees[neighbor] -= 1
                if degrees[neighbor] == 0:
                    q.append(neighbor)

        return count == numCourses
        ```
